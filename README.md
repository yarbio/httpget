this shortens long scripts into loadstrings. If your executor does not support HttpGet/loadstring, please refer to copy and pasting it. Other than that, use this template

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yarbio/httpget/main/Example)()

there you go.

please refer to; https://discord.gg/MEgjxDBWqB for scripts.
